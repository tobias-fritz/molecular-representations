# Molecular Representations

Different ways for representing structural information of molecules.

## Requirements

## How to use

## Pairwise distance matrix

- only coordinates (euclidean distance)
- sensitive to permutation of rows and columns
- use: could be used for implicit representation of molecular structures or as basis for computing more advanced representations like the coulomb matrix
